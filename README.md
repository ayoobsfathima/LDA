The focus of this study is to analyse how a random sample of the Indian society felt and reacted to two similar occasions where justice was required.  
The analysis was done by scraping tweets regarding the two issues and Latent Dirichlet  Allocation was performed on these two sets of tweets to extract 
the main topics in other words the essence of these tweets.
The two incidents were as follows:

Kerala Elephant:
The news of aÂ pregnant elephant that died in Kerala, on 27 May, after she ate a fruit that was stuffed with explosives, allegedly left by some locals, 
drew criticism and shock from people across the country. 
The elephant died in the Mannarkkad division of Palakkad district.

Safoora Zargar:
Zargar, a 27-year-old research scholar in sociology at Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi, was arrested on April 10 2020, 
on charges of blocking a road and obstructing traffic. After securing bail in that case, 
she was re-arrested on April 13 under the draconian provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. 
She was implicated in a conspiracy that allegedly sparked the violence that engulfed Delhi at the end of February and placed in judicial custody. At the time of her arrest, 
Safoora Zargar was pregnant. She has been denied bail third time since May and continues to stay in Tihar jail despite the corona pandemic
